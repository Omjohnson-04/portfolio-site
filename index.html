   <h1>Owen Johnson</h1>
   <br>
    <p>My goal is to eventually become a <em>data analyst</em>.
        I want to <br>learn how to build applications that can increase <br>peoples
        ability to simplify and analyze data in real-world<br> or even personal situations.
        <br><br>I currently serve in the Army National Guard where I am <br>
        training to become an officer. I hope to use the skills from the National<br>
        Guard in the signal corps to learn more about computers, networks, and boost my<br>
        overall civilian career.
